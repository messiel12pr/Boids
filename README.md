# [Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids)

Boids is an artificial life program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, which simulates the flocking behaviour of birds, 
and related group motion. His paper on this topic was published in 1987 in the proceedings of the ACM SIGGRAPH conference.
[1] The name "boid" corresponds to a shortened version of "bird-oid object", which refers to a bird-like object.[2] Reynolds' 
boid model is one example of a larger general concept, for which many other variations have been developed since. The closely 
related work of Ichiro Aoki is noteworthy because it was published in 1982 â€” five years before Reynolds' boids paper.
